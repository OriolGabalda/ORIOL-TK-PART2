=== TK PART 2 ===
I upload all the theme folder becasue in case you want to run it in a local machine with a basic wordpress install you can do it.

The only files that I have modified are the index.php file and all the files included in the gulp-project folder.
functions.php, header.php and footer.php are the originals.
